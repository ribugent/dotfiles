# Gerard Ribugent - Dotfiles

>_There's no place like üè°_

This repository contains all the dotfiles I use on my work computer.

All the files are managed using [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/), but the secrets and sensitive information are stored using [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/)

## Prerequisites

## Bootstrapping

0. Install needed software
1. Import my gpg keys
2. Clone password store

## Included configuration

### Arch Linux

Installing automatically packages and optional package dependencies using [yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay), the lists can be found in [1](arch-config/packages.txt) and [2](arch-config/packages-optional.txt).

Some drop in configuration system files are installed using `makepkg`:

- SDDM
  - Enable HiDPI in wayland
  - Disable listening http connections in xorg
  - Plasma Desktop settings
- Kernel parameters
  - Hardening
    - Restrict `dmesg` to root only
    - Disable `kexec` syscall
    - Restrict pointers in proc filesystem

- ~~[Reflector](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/reflector): Options for selecting the mirrors~~
- Systemd resolved

### Ssh

Basic ssh configuration with known host and rendering work sensitive hosts from the secret store using a template.

### Yay (Arch Linux only)

Setups system java, perl and python versions to avoid issues when building packages.
